This is the beginning of a project that I have had in mind for some
time, which I have now finally had the time commit to get it up and
running. For this endeavour I am hoping to write a blog fit for others
to read (well hopefully).

My plan is to write and post a blog on a ~~weekly basis for the next
year~~ semi-regular basis. Although this posting frequency may vary
slightly depending on how eventful life becomes and my time allows. I
don't have any particular target audience nor a reason to blog other
that for enjoyment. That is not to say that this won't evolve and
start to follow a pattern.

Obviously, it goes without say that my writing is my own opinion and
probably won't be reviewed, therefore should be taken with a pinch of
salt (as most things on the internet). I would like to think there
will be some integrity to may writing, but I might just piss it all
away on some whim.
