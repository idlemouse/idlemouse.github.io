Second post of the year and I am already behind my goal of one post a week. Which is unfortunate, but hopefully things will pick up again from here on out. I have a few ideas for the some future posts which I am looking forward to writing. It is just a matter of fixing a time to sit down and just write them.

I thought that I would keep things a bit simple for the second post and explain about my choice of blogging site. But first a story of days long past when I was at university and before the social media sites of today. In those bygone days we relied on MySpace (good purchase J.T.), which was a bit meh and too public. So in attempted to make something different I created a website (hacking together a bulletin-board and photo-hosting mess) which kinda worked. The plan was for it to be used for a small groups of friends to post-photos and messages in a closed community. Yes it was super fun to make, but it was a pain to maintain and difficult to add any additional functionality. Plus in the time when SMS and MSN messenger were king it was under used... time pasted and I didn't renew the hosting or keep the URL address or a backup of photos or messages (a shame).

Granted, it would be possible to hash something together and self-host a site on a micro-server at home without too much trouble. But alas creating and maintaining a site plus server has been such a time-vortex in the past that I fear it would detract for my other plans. Alternatively, I could use one of the many blogging sites for hosting my tiny blog, but I feel that they lack a bit of customisation (and soul).

Thus the current iteration of my blog is being hosting by [GitHub](https://github.com), which I feel is a happy alternative. Providing simplicity for hosting and full control of content. I am pretty happy so far. For the site I am using [Octopress](http://octopress.org) for the main skeleton with the [Bold-and-Blue](https://github.com/johnkeith/boldandblue) theme. Octopress utilises [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for fleshing out the pages themselves. Jekyll is a great program, which used converts the beautifully simplistic [markdown language](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) into tasty HTML code. Using this setup has the added advantage of use of static pages and thus avoid the headache of using databases to maintain content. Easy.
