### Beck - *Morning Phase*
*I like cake and I like this album*

Like a beautiful crafted piece of chocolate cake. You think you can
just listen to a single track, but soon you are under the spell of its
allure and quickly fall into a whole chocolate gorging session with
spoon doesn't seem to delivery large enough dollops of gooey
goodness. In essence, more stripped back than previous albums with
electronic sounds being replaced by strings. Leaving a almost operatic
sounding album. More overtly darker in content than Beck's previous
albums, but no less self indulgent. For me it is a gem, with Wave as
it beating heart, recalling memories of Radiohead's Pyramid Song, in
my book that is not a bad thing. A pleasure I could quiet happy enjoy
in repetition without any guilt.

### Cold Specks - *Neuroplasticity*
*Refined Dark Gospel*

Girlfriends past have accused me of being a music snob! Taking some
kind of giddy pleasure in listening to music of *obscure* bands and
judging other from my tower of records. Lies, scandalous lies, I say!
In light of such slanderous accusations against my music scruples. I
would like it to be known that I want people to know this album, it
needs to be heard. Darkly brooding, menacing reflection of the
undulating path one takes through life. It has feel of a finely
filtered blend of gospel, jazz and 60s psychedelia. With each listen
it has surprised me with the amount of raw passion that is exposed.

### Mogwai - *RAVE TAPES*
*Les Revenants*

Prior to releasing this album, Mogwai composed an amazing soundtrack
for the french TV series Les Revenants (The Returned). This album is
most definitely a very different beast. The former offers us a
orchestral delight, whereas this album displays the dexterity and
versatility that electronic music can offer. Taken together these two
albums portrays just how talented a band they are. The spectrum and
deliverance in RAVE TAPES is both board and sweeping. It has a feel of
music which they have taken a great pleasure in making and turning it
into a record as a after thought. Release towards the beginning of the
year I had planned to see them preform in Glasgow, but alas had to
sell my tickets as I had a job interview. 2014 the year I could have
seen Mogwai live in Glasgow, but instead got a new job. While this is
a detour from the like of past heights such as *Come On Die Young* I
still fell it is a noteworthy album of the year.
