It is finally here, I have added new material to my site! This time
around I have created a new page to house information about my
scientific [publications and presentations]({{ root_url }}/publications/). This includes links to my
published research articles and copies of my past conference poster
presentations, all of which are now freely available.

I had looked into publishing my past poster via the
[figshare](figshare.com) platform, but this seemed overkill for some
_very_ old posters which have undergone publication as research
articles. Therefore these previous presentations are being hosted via
public folders on my dropbox account. I would been keen to publish my
posters via [figshare](figshare.com) in the future. I think this is a
fantastic way to get promote research out to a wider audience than
those who were able to attend session to see your poster. Personally I
would have liked to see some poster from this years
[Society for Neuroscience](https://www.sfn.org/annual-meeting/neuroscience-2015)
meeting, which I was unable to attend this year. My boss did however
present our
[latest work](http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?sKey=42ce8b6b-6d97-4491-b123-8d437a182550&cKey=6973f8ca-6b49-4520-a891-b0d78a5c41c8&mKey={D0FF4555-8574-4FBB-B9D4-04EEC8BA0C84})
but as this was published in Journal of Neuroscience the exact same
week (__doi:__
[10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2541-15.2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2541-15.2015))
it seems more appropriate to promote the article over the poster. I am
hoping to go to FENS next year so perhaps that would be best try out
[figshare](figshare.com).

At the moment I don't have my PhD thesis available online. This is
mainly due to the submission predating the requirement for an
additional electronic submission at the University of Surrey. I very
much doubt it would get any attention, but I am a believer in free and
open research, so it is definitely something that I shall be looking
into. Perhaps the best way would be to ask the library at the
university to add it to those that they are currently
hosting. Alternatively I could host it via dropbox public folder which
is my current method for my posters, but it would be great to have a
more appropriate and prestigious home.
