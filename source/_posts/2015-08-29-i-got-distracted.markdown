It has been quite a while and my plans have gone awry from what I
wanted to do. Time to start again, maybe... As I had mentioned before
I am using [octopress]({% post_url 2015-01-19-stumbling-out-of-the-starting-gate %}), which works a treat
most of the time. There are a few novel quirks that it could do
without. Hopefully the release of octopress 3 will sort these out. I
had been putting off posting and waiting for the to the official
release and hence the delay. Today I spent a few hours trying to
migrating over my current blog with theme layout to latest version,
but hit a few brick walls and am thinking to now wait till some kind
souls creates some interesting new themes.


A list of posts I would like to write:

+ Finish post with review of 2014 albums
+ Write a entry on current my emacs GNUS/BBDB/MSTP setup
+ ~~Menu item to list publications~~
+ Upload some of my **R** functions
+ SQLite recursive functions and frustration of LinuxMint
+ Play around with **d3** some of my published data
