Below are listing for my scientific publications. As it stands, all my
research articles are freely available for download directly from the
publisher by following the __doi__ (digital object identifier)
link. Due to funding requirements for the more recent projects these
articles have been published under open access agreements. Whereas the
older articles are now outside their embargo periods.

Abstracts for the poster presentations are (with a bit of internet
archaeology) available online from the sites for the respective
conferences. I have collated the abstracts here mainly for my own
connivance and prosperity.

##Ph.D. Thesis

The physical copy of my Ph.D. thesis is housed at the University of
Surrey library and can be accessed via the British Library or
University of Surrey library. At present my thesis is not available
on-line, I plan to make this available online in the future.

##Public Engagement Events

While working as a post-doctoral researcher in the Neural Control of
Movement (NCM) lab in St Andrews I had the pleasure to partake in
several public engagement events. Highlights included "hands-on"
displays where members of the public were encouraged to handle
preserved brains. More information can be found on the outreach work
can be found on the
[NCM lab website](http://ncm.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/outreach/).

##Oral Presentations

The oral presentation below was selected to be presented at the
Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences Festival of Research at the
University of Surrey. My submitted abstract was chosen to represent
early- career researchers in the Chronobiology, Pharmacology and
Toxicology division at this annual event to highlight the work
undertaken within the faculty.
