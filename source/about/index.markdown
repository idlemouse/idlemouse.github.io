##Joshua Foster

{% img right /images/Josh-at-UCL.jpg 350 %} I am a post-doctoral
research scientist working at University College London. My research
interests are in neuronal control of movement and circuits within the
spinal cord. At present, my research is focused on characterising
final-order interneurons and mapping the synaptic strength of their
connections within the spinal locomotor networks. More information can
been found on the
[Beato Lab site](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/npp/research/mb), where I
currently based.

I have a interest in data analysis and in the future I would like to
move into data science. Preferably with a focus on functional or
another quantitative data type. To aid with this transition, I am in
the process of expanding my programming fluency. I have a knowledge of
__Python__, __SQLite__, __R__ and __Matlab__.

One of my life-long passions is music. I love just listening to music
for hours-on-end or heading out to a venue to watching live music or
comedy. The rest of my time is generally taken up with computer
related fun/development, film and books.
