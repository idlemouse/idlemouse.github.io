    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Second post of the year and I am already behind my goal of one post a week. Which is unfortunate, but hopefully things will pick up again from here on out. I have a few ideas for the some future posts which I am looking forward to writing. It is just a matter of fixing a time to sit down and just write them.</p>

<p>I thought that I would keep things a bit simple for the second post and explain about my choice of blogging site. But first a story of days long past when I was at university and before the social media sites of today. In those bygone days we relied on MySpace (good purchase J.T.), which was a bit meh and too public. So in attempted to make something different I created a website (hacking together a bulletin-board and photo-hosting mess) which kinda worked. The plan was for it to be used for a small groups of friends to post-photos and messages in a closed community. Yes it was super fun to make, but it was a pain to maintain and difficult to add any additional functionality. Plus in the time when SMS and MSN messenger where king it was under used&hellip; time pasted and I didn&rsquo;t renew the hosting or keep the URL address or a backup of photos or messages (a shame).</p>

<p>Granted, it would be possible to hash something together and self-host a site on a micro-server at home without too much trouble. But alas creating and maintaining a site plus server has been such a time-vortex in the past that I fear it would detract for my other plans. Alternatively, I could use one of the many blogging sites for hosting my tiny blog, but I feel that they lack a bit of customisation (and soul).</p>

<p>Thus the current iteration of my blog is being hosting by <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, which I feel is a happy alternative. Providing simplicity for hosting and full control of content. I am pretty happy so far. For the site I am using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octpress</a> for the main skeleton with the <a href="https://github.com/johnkeith/boldandblue">Bold-and-Blue</a> theme. Octpress utilises <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> for fleshing out the pages themselves. Jekyll is a great program, which used converts the beautifully simplistic <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">markdown language into tasty HTML code</a>. Using this setup has the added advantage of use of static pages and thus avoid the headache of using databases to maintain content. Easy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the beginning of a project that I have had in mind for some time, which I have now finally had the time commit to get it up and running. For this endeavour I am hoping to  write a blog fit for others to read (well hopefully).</p>

<p>My plan is to write and post a blog on a weekly basis for the next year. Although this posting frequency may vary slightly depending on how eventful life becomes and my time allows. I don&rsquo;t have any particular target audience nor a reason to blog other that for enjoyment. That is not to say that this won&rsquo;t evolve and start to follow a pattern.</p>

<p>Obviously, it goes without say that my writing is my own opinion and probably won&rsquo;t be reviewed, therefore should be taken with a pinch of salt (as most things on the internet). I would like to think there will be some integrity to may writing, but I might just piss it all away on some whim.</p>
