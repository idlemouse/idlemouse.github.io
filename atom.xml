    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been using GNU/Linux on-and-off for quiet some time now. My
first experience was using PPC editions of SuSE on my iBook back in
the early 2000s and later Mandrake on my beat-up PC. But I never
really got into using for my default go-to operating system. Plus
coming from a DOS background made using UNIX a little bewildering. A
lot has changed since then.</p>

<p>I have had dual-boot Linux/Windows systems for a long time now, but it
has only been more recently that I switch to using GNU/Linux as my
day-to-day system. <em>With the exception of a month where I switch to
solely using linux while I was writing a chapter of my PhD thesis,
however I found I was using a Windows virtual machine far too much and
switched back.</em> One of the main reasons for my conversion to
GNU/Linux, this time around, was the implantation of statistical
programming language <strong>R</strong> during my first post-doc job at the University
of St Andrews. The many aim was to make circular plots and circular
statistics, without having to use a clunky third-party plugin for
Excel. But the ability to identically batch process data and making
beautiful graphics really sold it for me. However, since then I have
been more included to use <strong>MATLAB</strong>, although not perfect, it is a more
complete solution and allows for user-interfaces.</p>

<p>At present, I am using a mix between Xubuntu (on my home desktop),
Linux-Mint (office desktop) and Arch-Linux (laptop/chromebook), all
using the sleek xfce graphical environment. Arch-Linux has been my
most recent discovery, although not for the faint hearted or the UNIX
reluctant, it is my current distribution of choice. When first
installed it is just a bare-bone terminal, from which to build on to
get to a complete usable system. It can, and did for me, take a entire
weekends work to get an installed and fully functional system. Which
has really force me to delve into UNIX/Linux to a much greater extent
that I would have done otherwise. But it has provided me a neat system
with just the elements, and that suits me just fine. Plus it is
something that you have lovely crafted and customised which only add
to it charm.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Second post of the year and I am already behind my goal of one post a week. Which is unfortunate, but hopefully things will pick up again from here on out. I have a few ideas for the some future posts which I am looking forward to writing. It is just a matter of fixing a time to sit down and just write them.</p>

<p>I thought that I would keep things a bit simple for the second post and explain about my choice of blogging site. But first a story of days long past when I was at university and before the social media sites of today. In those bygone days we relied on MySpace (good purchase J.T.), which was a bit meh and too public. So in attempted to make something different I created a website (hacking together a bulletin-board and photo-hosting mess) which kinda worked. The plan was for it to be used for a small groups of friends to post-photos and messages in a closed community. Yes it was super fun to make, but it was a pain to maintain and difficult to add any additional functionality. Plus in the time when SMS and MSN messenger where king it was under used&hellip; time pasted and I didn&rsquo;t renew the hosting or keep the URL address or a backup of photos or messages (a shame).</p>

<p>Granted, it would be possible to hash something together and self-host a site on a micro-server at home without too much trouble. But alas creating and maintaining a site plus server has been such a time-vortex in the past that I fear it would detract for my other plans. Alternatively, I could use one of the many blogging sites for hosting my tiny blog, but I feel that they lack a bit of customisation (and soul).</p>

<p>Thus the current iteration of my blog is being hosting by <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, which I feel is a happy alternative. Providing simplicity for hosting and full control of content. I am pretty happy so far. For the site I am using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> for the main skeleton with the <a href="https://github.com/johnkeith/boldandblue">Bold-and-Blue</a> theme. Octopress utilises <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> for fleshing out the pages themselves. Jekyll is a great program, which used converts the beautifully simplistic <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">markdown language</a> into tasty HTML code. Using this setup has the added advantage of use of static pages and thus avoid the headache of using databases to maintain content. Easy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the beginning of a project that I have had in mind for some time, which I have now finally had the time commit to get it up and running. For this endeavour I am hoping to  write a blog fit for others to read (well hopefully).</p>

<p>My plan is to write and post a blog on a weekly basis for the next year. Although this posting frequency may vary slightly depending on how eventful life becomes and my time allows. I don&rsquo;t have any particular target audience nor a reason to blog other that for enjoyment. That is not to say that this won&rsquo;t evolve and start to follow a pattern.</p>

<p>Obviously, it goes without say that my writing is my own opinion and probably won&rsquo;t be reviewed, therefore should be taken with a pinch of salt (as most things on the internet). I would like to think there will be some integrity to may writing, but I might just piss it all away on some whim.</p>
