    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the beginning of a project that I have had in mind for some time, which I have now finally had the time commit to get it up and running. For this endeavour I am hoping to  write a blog fit for others to read (well hopefully).</p>

<p>My plan is to write and post a blog on a weekly basis for the next year. Although this posting frequency may vary slightly depending on how eventful life becomes and my time allows. I don&rsquo;t have any particular target audience nor a reason to blog other that for enjoyment. That is not to say that this won&rsquo;t evolve and start to follow a pattern.</p>

<p>Obviously, it goes without say that my writing is my own opinion and probably won&rsquo;t be reviewed, therefore should be taken with a pinch of salt (as most things on the internet). I would like to think there will be some integrity to may writing, but I might just piss it all away on some whim.</p>
