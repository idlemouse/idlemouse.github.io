quite a while and my plans went awry from that I had planned. Time to
start again&hellip; As I had mentioned before I am using <strong>octopress</strong>,
which works a treat most of the time. There are a few novel quirks
that it could do without. Hopefully the release of octopress 3 will
sort these out. I had been putting off posting and waiting for the to
the official release and hence the delay. Today I spent a few hours
trying to migrating over my current blog with theme layout to latest
version, but hid a few brick walls and am thinking to now wait till
some kind souls creates some interesting new themes.</p>

<p>A list of post I would like to write:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finish albums from last year post</li>
<li>Write a entry on current my emacs GNUS/BBDB/MSTP setup</li>
<li>Menu item to list publication</li>
<li>Upload some of my <strong>R</strong> functions</li>
<li>SQLite recursive functions and frustration of LinuxMint</li>
<li>Play around with <strong>d3</strong> some of my published data</li>
</ul>
